                <li style="font-size: 20px;"><b style="font-size:">Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation of Hilton International: </b> In the spring of 2020, I enrolled in a financial modeling course at OU. The centerpiece of the course is the DCF project where teams of three students collaborate to conduct a valuation of a selected company using a pro-forma model. My part of the project was to build the model itself in Excel, so I created an interactive dashboard along with the three financial statements and an analysis section.

                <li style="font-size: 20px;"><b>RFM Statistical Segmentation:</b>  In the summer of 2020 during my internship as a Financial Data Analyst at First United Bank, I was tasked to lead an analytics project that would benefit multiple bank departments such as marketing, sales, and analytics. The purpose of the project was to use any software of my choice to create customer segments to classify 100K consumer checking customers and 5k business checking customers who took out PPP loans. To carry out the project, I had to read through scholarly articles to understand the type of segmentation I wanted to employ, and I also chose to create a project outline for me to follow throughout the summer. In order to conduct the segmentation, I taught myself how to use Alteryx, an advanced analytics suite. Using Alteryx allowed me to employ a statistical method known as k-means clustering to make a program that automatically segments the customer sample into six unique groups. Once the segments had been created, I used Tableau to visualize the data to show the impact of the project to bank executives. The project was a major development for the analytics department as laid a foundation for the team to begin exploring predictive analytics.
