            <ul>
                <li style="font-size: 20px;"><b style="font-size:">Finance:</b>  I have had a long held interest in Finance as it is something that I have grown up around. This interest led me to choose a major in Finance coming into college. As I took finance courses and got involved in professional organizations in the Price College of Business, I began to confirm my interest in banking. In the summer of 2020, I interned as a Financial Data Analyst for First United Bank. This internship gave me a great exposure to banking and analytics, and it pushed me to continue exploring banking. To further this exploration, I interned for Goldman Sachs in the summer of 2021 as a Global Markets Summer Analyst in the firm's Dallas office.</li>
                <li style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Consulting:</b>  The other career interest that I have taken time to explore and gain experience in is management consulting. I was initially interested in consulting after learning about it from a relative who worked as a management consultant. I then researched about the profession, spoke with alumni at top firms, practiced case interviews, and in the fall of 2020 I took up a position as a consultant for The Oklahoma Group (TOG), a pro-bono nonprofit consulting organization at the University of Oklahoma. In TOG I went through a lot of professional development. I became a better researcher, writer, and speaker as a result of collecting and presenting a semester’s worth of research to my team’s client.</li>
